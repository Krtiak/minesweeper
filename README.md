# Minesweeper Game

Welcome to the Minesweeper game project! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that contains the structure of the game, including the grid for the Minesweeper board and user interaction elements.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet that defines the visual aspects of the game, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic, including functions for initializing the game, handling user interactions, and checking win/loss conditions.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the tiles to reveal them. If you click on a mine, the game is over!
3. The numbers on the revealed tiles indicate how many mines are adjacent to that tile.
4. Use the numbers to deduce where the mines are located and avoid them.
5. The goal is to clear all the tiles without clicking on any mines.
